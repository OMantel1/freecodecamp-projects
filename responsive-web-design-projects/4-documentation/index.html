                </header>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages
                    interactive
                    (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more
                    advanced
                    server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to
                    a
                    website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple
                    computers).
                    Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects
                    of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set
                    of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended
                    for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser
                        and
                        its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                        place
                        elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
                        page
                        navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript
                        on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application,
                        or
                        perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And,
                    likewise,
                    Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the
                    browser.

                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your
                    first
                    "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
                <pre>
    <code> 
        function greetMe(yourName) {
            alert('Hello ' + yourName);

                <header>
                    <h2>Variables</h2>
                </header>

                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                    called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                    Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
                <header>

                    <h2>Declaring variables</h2>
                </header>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                    <p>With the keyword var. For example <code>var x = 42</code></p>
                    <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                    <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42</code></p>
                    <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't
                        use this variant.</p>
                    <p>With the keyword let. For example, <code>let y = 13</code> </p>
                    <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>


            </section>


            <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
                <header>
                    <h2>Variable scope</h2>
                </header>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                    available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function,
                    it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
                    within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example
                    the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within
                    which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>
            </section>


            <section class="main-section" id="global_variables">
                <header>
                    <h2>Global variables</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is
                    window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
                <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
                    frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
                    declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
